# 📌 Covid-19 Data Analysis & Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview
This project applies various Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze and predict Covid-19 cases based on the provided dataset. It includes both traditional ML models and advanced techniques like PCA and ANN (Artificial Neural Networks).

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset used is **full_grouped.csv**.
- It contains Covid-19 case statistics, including:
  - Confirmed Cases
  - Recovered Cases
  - Deaths
  - Active Cases (Derived Feature)

## 🛠️ Implemented Machine Learning Models
The project explores multiple ML techniques:
1. **Linear Regression** – For basic predictive modeling.
2. **Random Forest Regressor** – To improve prediction accuracy using an ensemble method.
3. **K-Means Clustering** – For grouping data (if applicable).
4. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** – Implemented using MLPRegressor.
5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) + ANN** – Dimensionality reduction for efficient learning.
6. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** – For feature selection and projection.

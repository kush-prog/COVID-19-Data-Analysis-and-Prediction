# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction

## 📝 **Project Overview**
This project analyzes and predicts trends in COVID-19 cases using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and includes country-wise statistics of confirmed, recovered, deaths, and active cases over time. The goal is to provide meaningful insights and make predictions using Linear Regression and Random Forest models.

## 🚀 **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, scales data, and performs feature engineering.
- **Trend Analysis:** Visualizes key trends like daily cases, recoveries, and fatalities.
- **Prediction Models:** Implements Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor to predict active cases.
- **Clustering (Optional):** Groups countries based on case trends using K-Means clustering.

## 📂 **Dataset**
- **Name:** COVID-19 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report)
- **Description:** Provides country-wise daily updates of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and more.

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models.

## 📊 **Machine Learning Algorithms**
1. **Linear Regression:**
   - Predicts active cases based on features like confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
   - Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² score.
   
2. **Random Forest Regressor:**
   - Provides more robust predictions for active cases with non-linear relationships.
   - Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² score.

3. **(Optional) K-Means Clustering:**
   - Groups countries based on similar trends in COVID-19 metrics.
